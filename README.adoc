= spring-session-sample-boot-webflux-custom-cookie

This is a sample derived from:
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session

There seems to be no supported, documented or easy way to override the session cookie name created by spring security.
The method to achieve a custom cookie here involves overriding Spring classes and spring-session-data-redis classes
in a non-sustainable manner without actually using a redis server.

Nevertheless this method allows choosing a custom cookie name until Spring provides a solution.
